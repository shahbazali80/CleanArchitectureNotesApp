    // inheritance and its type ✅

    // abstraction, how can we do ? how can we achieve 100% abstraction. ✅
    // access modifier ✅
    // Updated data state class with sealed class ✅         -> It makes sure you handle all possible states, so your code is safer and less likely to break.
    // Updated FlowState with SharedSate✅                   -> Ideal for one-time events or actions (like navigation, toasts, or messages), whereas StateFlow is best for holding and observing state.
